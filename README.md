Problem Statement – Quality Education
Title:
"Enhancing Accessibility and Engagement in Quality Education through a Web-Based Learning Platform"
 
Problem Statement:
Despite advancements in technology, many students—especially in rural and underserved areas—still lack access to high-quality, affordable, and engaging educational resources. Traditional classroom education often fails to cater to diverse learning styles, language preferences, and individual learning speeds. Furthermore, the absence of interactive tools and personalized feedback makes learning monotonous and ineffective for many students.
 
There is a critical need for a digital solution that bridges the education gap by providing inclusive, engaging, and outcome-driven learning experiences, accessible anytime and from anywhere.
 
Objectives of the Project

Enable Multi-format Learning: Incorporate videos, quizzes, notes, and interactive lessons.
 
Track Progress: Allow students to view their progress, get instant feedback, and receive guidance.
